# dmav-cc

A silly lil collection of plotting codes.

What this folder actually is:

- A grab bag of short Python scripts that make charts move and occasionally look alive.
- Stuff here ranges from disciplined sine waves to scatter plots having identity crises.

Files you might enjoy:

- `line.py` and `dyn_line.py` - lines that refuse to stand still.
- `scatter.py` and `dyn_scatter.py` - dots with places to be and feelings to show.
- `sin_cos.py` and `dyn_sin_cos.py` - trigonometry doing interpretive dance.
- `histogram.py` and `dyn_histogram.py` - bars that will not be ignored.
- `pie.py` and `dyn_pie.py` - pies you can plot but should not attempt to eat.
- `bar.py` and `dyn_bar.py` - bar charts lifting weights.
- `animatecircle.py` - a circle practicing its orbit.
- `animated_line.py` - because one animated line was not enough.

Quick start:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 and matplotlib installed. If not, run:

```
pip3 install matplotlib
```

2. Run whatever looks fun. For example:

```
python3 dyn_sin_cos.py
```
